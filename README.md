# NodeJS Refresher using MongoDB, Express, and Google oAuth login

## Goal
I'd like to create a few small projects to get my head in the game once more as a web developer. I figured the best place to start for now is probably NodeJS along with Express and MongoDB with a very simple application following Traversy Medias video for general guidance.

This app uses Materialize UI to make things quicker since this is just a follow along tutorial. Passport is used for google oAuth20. NodeJS and Express are used to handle backend and middleware. The database uses MongoDB. Handlebars is used for templating.

Over the next couple of weeks I would like to build at least 3 or 4 projects, each with a different area of focus to refresh my memory on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, UI design, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and React. Anything new I learn from these projects will simply be a bonus. I'm hoping to build up to a full stack MERN application built from scratch, complete with custom UI design. So far the idea is to give my wife a cross platform app where she can save and view her favorite cooking recipes.

UPDATE: It seems my weakest link as of right now is React. NodeJS and the backend/middleware in general was an absolute breeze and it's almost like I never stopped using these. React on the other hand is taking some getting used to, but it's getting easier the more I use it naturally.
